Hello, Fellow Stats Blogger!

Say one desires to post to this venerable blog. How would you do that? 

## Step 1: 

__Fork the repo:__

Go to [github.com/nstrayer/nashvilleBioStats](http://github.com/nstrayer/nashvilleBioStats) and fork the repository (upper right corner).

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/fork.png" alt = "Forking">
</div>

Once you have the repo forked it should look approximately like the photo above. From there, copy the url in the "HTTPS" box and in the command line run: `git clone <yourURL>`. 

Now get into the newly deposited repository (`cd nashvilleBioStats`). Once inside of this repo really only one thing matters and that is the `_source` directory. If you navigate inside of it you will see that there are a bunch of `.Rmd` files in it. This is where the magic happens. 

---

## Step 2: 

__Make a new post:__

At this point you could just generate a new `Rmd` in anyway you desire, but for the sake of sanity I would suggest copying an existing one in the `_source/` directory as the header is a tad bit different than what you probably have used before. (Alternatively you could just start from scratch and make sure to copy in the top of an already used file.)

### File Naming: 

This is important. The name of the file you use helps the blog know information about it. You must start the file name with the date in the format `year-month-day-postTitle.Rmd`. 

For example: if I were to create a simple post I would do the following in the terminal. 

```{bash}
cd nashvilleBioStats/_source
cp 2015-12-19-howTo.Rmd 2015-12-20-newPost.Rmd
rStudio 2015-12-20-newPost.Rmd
```


```{r, fig.align='center'}
hist(rexp(1000, 2))
```
